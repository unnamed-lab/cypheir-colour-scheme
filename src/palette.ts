/* 
    Creating Your Palette:
        Start with a key color (often the dominant hue in your design).
        Choose a primary color (usually the key color).
        Add secondary colors (harmonious companions).
        Introduce accent colors (for highlights and emphasis).
        Consider the context (branding, mood, target audience).
    
        Choosing Accent Colors:
            No strict rules: There are no fixed rules for choosing accent colors, but consider the following guidelines:
            Set the mood: Think about the overall tone you want to create in the room. Choose an accent color that aligns with that mood.
            Color harmony: Look at the existing color scheme in the room. Consider using complementary or analogous colors for harmonious results.
            Contrast: Accent colors should stand out against the primary colors. Differences in hue, value, or saturation help achieve proper contrast.
